Review the AWS-QuickSetup-SSMHostMgmt.yaml AWS CloudFormation template for customized Quick Setup. This template has been updated as described in the following list:

* The default option to periodically update the Systems Manager agent, collect inventory, and scan for patches is changed from true to false. This helps avoid collisions with existing Systems Manager configurations and setups that you have deployed. You can change these to true if you want to enable these features.
* The default option to install and periodically update the CloudWatch agent is changed from false to true. This enables the CloudWatch installation, configuration, and update by default.
* The Name property for the Systems Manager documents is commented out so that the names are dynamically generated by AWS CloudFormation. This enables you to more easily update the documents with AWS CloudFormation without having to perform renaming operations. Naming Systems Manager documents in AWS CloudFormation prevents you from updating them because a change in the document results in a replacement of the existing document.
* A customer-managed policy is added to provide read access to the S3 bucket containing the CloudWatch configurations.
* The AWS-QuickSetup-HostMgmtRole role permissions are updated to include permissions to attach the CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy, the S3 customer managed policy, and refinements for least privileged access.
* Additional steps are added to the AWSQuickSetup-CreateAndAttachIAMToInstance Systems Manager document to include the CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy AWS managed IAM policy and the customer-managed policy for Amazon S3 access.
* An additional step is added to the AWSQuickSetup-UpdateExistingInstanceProfile Systems Manager document to include the CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy AWS managed IAM policy and the customer-managed policy for Amazon S3 access.
* Additional steps are added to the AWSQuickSetup-InstallAndManageCloudWatchDocument Systems Manager document to download CloudWatch configuration files from the S3 bucket containing your standard CloudWatch configurations. Steps are added to stop and restart the CloudWatch agent after the configuration files are downloaded.
